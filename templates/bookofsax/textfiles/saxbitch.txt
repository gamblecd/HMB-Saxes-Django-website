Toby Nelson:  Our Sloppy SAX Bitch
 

"FANTASTIC!"
 
"I drink to forget everything that I regret."
  
Long ago there was a group of women in the SAX Section who were proud to be 
called the "SAX Bitches". The rest of the women were called "SAX Babes". Today 
all the women in the SAX Section are called SAX Babes. To keep up with the 
tradition of the "SAX Bitches", the SAXES have made Toby Nelson our official 
SAX Bitch.  Even though he does not play SAXOPHONE (he plays one of those high 
brass things) we have considered him part of our section as the SAX Bitch.
