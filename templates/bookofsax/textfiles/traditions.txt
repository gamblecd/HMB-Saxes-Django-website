Rookie Traditions
=================

Guide Me Home:
	A game performed by rookies after dinner and before Family Night. The game
	is played in pairs, usually consisting of a rookie guy and a rookie Sax
	Babe. The rookie Babe holds a roll of toilet paper between her knees, and 
	the guy holds a broom stick with his legs. The guy is then blindfolded, and 
	the rookie Babe must guide the guy to put his broomstick into the hole of 
	the toilet paper roll, using only her voice.

The Sax Song
============

The Sax Song is sung on various occasions, and should be sung to the tune of
'Spirit of Washington' apparently. The words are as follows:

	"Sooooo, drink! We're the Saxes of Washington, the cocky and the blitzed.

	Sooooo, drink! We're the Saxes of Washington, forever with the Schmidts.

	The Saxes of Washington have balls to last,
	
	A legion of drinkers leading sax attacks!

	So drink (orange soda)! With the Husky Band!

	So drink (iced tea)! With a Schmidts in hand!

	We will fuck WAZZU and go to hell,

	We're the bad-ass saxophones!"

Bow Testing
===========

Each rookie is expected to be able to sing 'Bow Down To Washington' perfectly by 
themselves by the time of the first Full Band away trip. The tests will be 
performed on the buses, en route to the destination city.

Sax Warmups
===========

Sax Warm-ups are done before we march our pregame show to get us psyched for 
marching and the game. The saxes were the first section to do warm-ups before 
pregame and now all the other sections do it too. Here is some history behind 
the warm-ups we do:

Todd Mahaffey Wave
	Todd Mahaffey was a trumpet player in the band. He was a real dick. He later
    quit band and became a Resident Advisor in McMahon Hall. He ruined all our 
    Friday night rally prefunks and even kicked a sax player out of McMahon 
    Hall.
    
    To do the wave you put your left hand on your right bicep and fold your 
    right arm up.
    
Trumpet Wave
    This is our tribute to the members of the trumpet section, who cannot hold 
    their alcohol.
    
    To do this, you bow down and make a puking sound.

Kibby Wave
    This is a salute to Rachel McKibbin, who was a sax from long ago and very 
    short.
    
    This is done by lifting your jacket flap and showing your butt.

Andrew Abed Dance
    This is a tribute to a trombone, Andrew Abed, who tried to fight the saxes 
    with this silly dance.
   
    This is done by holding up two fists in front of your face alternating up 
    and down while singing "The Hustle."

Shotguns
    This warm-up is to simulate how fast the saxes are able to consume "milk" 
    and is usually led by our Section Leaders.
    
    This is a four count move:
        
        *  First, stick out your hand like you're holding a "milk" can. 
        *  Second, put your hand on top getting ready to open it.
        *  Third, open the top. 
        *  Fourth, swiftly guzzle down the "milk". 
	       (Could be repeated as many times as Section Leader wants)

Keg Lifts
    Simulate lifting a keg which, of course, contains "milk" for our consumtion 
    after the game.
    
    To do this, squat on the ground with your arms pretending to hold the keg 
    and slowly lift it up. (Some choose to drink the contents.)

Vat Lifts
    Uses all the saxes to carry a vat of "milk".
    
    To do this, while in a circle, everyone puts their arms RIGHT OVER LEFT and 
    slowly lifts a huge vat.

6-Pack Runs 
    Sprints to help get us ready for the run-on.
    
    With altos on one side and tenors on the other, we run across passing a 
    6-pack of drinks. Often there are themes to each run across, themes are 
    chosen on a individual or group basis.
    

Sax Sit
    After most of the warm-ups, we utilize the sax sit to cool down.
    
    To do this, while in a circle, everyone sticks their right arm in the middle
    and gets close together. Once we're packed, we all lean back and sit on the 
    lap of the person behind you.  This usually works if we're in a good tight 
    circle.

Pose Down
    This is done for the Sax Babes by the oldest male saxes.
    
    The male saxes pick poses to show off their muscles to the Babes, while the 
    Babes admire their physiques.
