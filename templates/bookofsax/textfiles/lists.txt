Shit that Licks Ass
===================

By: Brett Bever

Yes, we've all admired Zack Smith's seemingly endless list of "Shit that
kicks ass", but the unfourtuane reality of our complex universe is that
for every item on the list of "Shit that kicks ass," there must be an
equal number for the dreaded list of "Shit that LICKS ass." This horrific
but necessary dichotomy must exist for us to truly appreciate the better
things in life. 

-----Avoid the following at all costs:----

*  Chick movies
*  The American Brodcasting Company
*  Mellophone sectionals
*  Goddamn 12-cent copies
*  That fish smell
*  The ACC
*  People who bleed on you when you hit them
*  The Queen
*  The Vatican
*  The Gettys
*  The Rothchilds
*  Colonal Sanders
*  Piccolos in the night
*  Straight jackets
*  Idiots who smoke right outside the HUB 
*  House plants
*  Slow service at restaurants
*  Syrup instead of jelly
*  The USC Band
*  Three white guys playin' horse
*  When they bleep out the fuckin' swear words on TV
*  The color red
*  Getting hit in the sack while playing "Louie"
*  Getting hit in the sack. Period.
*  Tight marching band pants
*  Being po'
*  Three white guys playing ANYTHING
*  Beer o'clock
*  Electric shock
*  Tossin' salad (I perfer jelly)
